## ✅ Features Completed

### Core Features

- ✅ **Group Chat Creation**: Create groups with name, photo, and contract address
- ✅ **Token Gating**: NFT verification for the contract `0xb5abff5c7f8cd72c302c4b70743c6069370a5952`

- ✅ **PWA Support**: Add to home screen, mobile notifications
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: Modern minimalistic dark theme throughout

### Technical Implementation

- ✅ **Prisma**: Database ORM with SQLite (production-ready for PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **NextAuth**: Secure authentication system
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- ✅ **Web3 Integration**: Ethereum wallet connection and NFT verification
- ✅ **Push Notifications**: Service worker and notification system

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

3. **Configure Twitter OAuth**:
   - Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/)
   - Create a new app with OAuth 2.0
   - Set callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitter`
   - Add your credentials to `.env.local`:
     ```
     TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
     NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📱 Mobile PWA Installation

Once running:
1. Open the app in a mobile browser
2. Look for the "Install HiveApp" prompt
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen" or "Install"
4. The app will work like a native mobile app with push notifications

## 🔐 Token Gating Setup

The app is pre-configured for the contract address you specified:
`0xb5abff5c7f8cd72c302c4b70743c6069370a5952`

When creating a group:
1. Add this contract address in the "Token Contract Address" field
2. Only users who own NFTs from this contract can access the group
3. Users must connect their Ethereum wallet to verify ownership

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark mode with blue accents
- **Minimalistic UI**: Clean, modern interface focused on usability
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design that works perfectly on mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions and loading states
- **Professional Typography**: Clean, readable fonts

## 📧 Push Notifications

To enable push notifications:

1. Generate VAPID keys:
   ```bash
   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
   ```

2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ```

3. Users will be prompted to allow notifications when they join groups
